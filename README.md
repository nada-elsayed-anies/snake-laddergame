# snake-laddergame
it was our first project and we was asked to use c++ so for that reason we coded it using sfml for gui 
it could be played with at least 2 players and at most 14 
after you clicked play you can write the number of players and there names on the console window 
the code is not profitional at all .. but it was our first time
